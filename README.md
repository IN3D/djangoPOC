A Django proof of concept using pypy3 and mongoDB via mongoengine

I made this a git repo mostly so I wouldn't loose track of the code in it.
There are plenty of examples of 'sensitive' keys and what not in here mostly because this code
is never going to go up on any server, anywhere.

A requirements.txt file is included with what was in my local pypy3 virtual environment (not very much, honestly).
This again, was done just for the sake of keeping track of this code, and replicating something similar to
it elsewhere
